# A Dual Stage Deep Convolutional Neural Network for Automatic diagnosis of COVID-19 and Pneumonia from Chest CT Images
## Abstract:
In the Coronavirus disease-2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, for fast and accurate diagnosis of a large number of patients, besides traditional methods, automated diagnostic tools are now extremely required. In this paper, a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) based scheme is proposed for automated accurate diagnosis of COVID-19 from lung computed tomography (CT) scan images.
